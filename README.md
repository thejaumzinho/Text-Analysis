# Text Analysis Project with AI

This repository was created as part of my DIO learning journey to practice text analysis concepts and enhance my GitHub portfolio

## Project Structure
- **inputs/**: Contains the `sentences.txt` file with sentences about my Java learning goals.
- **README.md**: Documents the process and insights.

## Text Analysis
I asked the AI to analyze my `sentences.txt`, and here are the insights:
- **Sentence 1**: "I’m excited to learn Java this year" - Shows motivation and a clear plan to learn a key programming language.
- **Sentence 2**: "Programming in Java opens many doors in the job market" - Reflects my understanding of Java’s value in the industry.
- **Sentence 3**: "I want to master Java and build amazing projects!" - Highlights ambition and a desire to apply knowledge in practical projects.

## Possibilities
- Build small Java projects (e.g., a calculator or simple game) and add them here.
- Explore frameworks like Spring for more advanced applications.
- Track my Java learning progress in this repository.
